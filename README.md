# Risk Analytics Case Study

This case study aims to develop a fundamental understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services. The goal is to explore how data is utilized to minimize the risk of financial losses when lending to customers. The study follows a structured analysis approach, encompassing various steps from data cleaning to correlation matrix exploration.

## Steps:
### Step 1: Data Cleaning
In the initial step, data cleaning procedures were implemented to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset.
Columns with a significant percentage of missing values and those providing limited value were removed.
Data types were appropriately converted, and derived variables were introduced for deeper analysis.

### Step 2: Univariate Analysis**
Univariate analysis was conducted to understand the distribution and characteristics of individual variables.
Key features such as loan amount, funded amount, approved loan amount ratio, interest rate, and loan status were examined.
Visualizations, including box plots and histograms, were utilized to provide insights into the data.

### Step 3: Segmented Univariate Analysis
Further analysis was carried out by segmenting the data based on key parameters like loan term and borrower grade.
Relationships between variables such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan status were explored within these segments.

### Step 4: Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
In this step, the interplay between different variables was investigated.
Relationships between loan term and loan status, grade and loan status, and interest rate and loan status were visualized and analyzed.
Box plots, bar plots, and other visualizations were employed to highlight patterns and trends.

### Step 5: Correlation Matrix
A correlation matrix was generated to quantify the relationships between various numerical variables.
The matrix provided a comprehensive overview of how different factors interact with each other.
